Once you get the key, you need to beat 2 more bosses in order to get to the door which gets you out of here. I wish you luck. I wrote this note before I died. Good luck and have fun!!! Hope you make it out of here alive.. PS: If you try killing the minions or the boss without a sword, they will easily kill you. You have no chance. Even if you find a glitch to get to the door without killing the bosses, without the key, you can't open it. If you try to open it or try to break it, it will activate a booby trap which will activate spikes to come from the floor and the walls will start to close in. If you somehow survive, a bomb will go off so either way, you are going to die. Have fun!!! Have a good day too.\n";
